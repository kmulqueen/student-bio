            <p>Kyle Mulqueen is an aspiring web developer based in Denver, CO. He is completely new to web development and coding,
                but is excited to see where this new journey will take him. His background is in music performance; he is
                a drummer. He graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver in 2017 with a BM in Jazz Performance
                with an emphasis in drum-set. Kyle's ability to improvise and adapt to new and unfamiliar situations will
                help him (hopefully) become a professional web developer.</p>
